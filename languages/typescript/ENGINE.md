## Spike S-TS1: does it build as a dependency?

Answer: **yes**, by `git` + `rev`, with no patch, no feature flag and no environment variable.

Measured on macOS (Darwin 23.6.0), Rust 1.99.1, `cargo build --release`, cold target directory, warm registry:

| Crates | Cold build | Binary |
|---|---|---|
| `tsrs_parser` + `tsrs_ast` + `tsrs_core` (parse a string, count statements) | 20 s | 2.1 MB |
| + `tsrs_compiler` + `tsrs_tsoptions` + `tsrs_vfs` + `tsrs_checker` + `tsrs_ls` (load a one-file program) | 1 m 33 s | 16.5 MB |

- The parser-only crate printed `statements: 2` for a two-function file.
- The full crate loaded a folder with one `a.ts`: `files: 91` (the file plus the bundled `lib.*.d.ts`), `global diagnostics: 0`. The user needs no
  `typescript` package: the libs are bundled (`tsrs_vfs::bundled`).
- **No mimalloc** was installed as the global allocator in either spike, and nothing broke. Speed with and without it was not measured.
- Cargo resolved 83 packages for the full crate; the lockfile is the spike's, not ours.
- Not yet checked: Linux and Windows builds (CI does that once a real crate depends on the engine).
- `Context::default()` was enough to call `get_global_diagnostics`; how to cancel a context from outside is still open (TS5).

How the program was loaded (the shape `sem.rs` will wrap):

```rust
let fs: Arc<dyn FS> = Arc::new(bundled::wrap_fs(cachedvfs::from(osvfs::fs())));
let config = tsrs_tsoptions::new_parsed_command_line(P::new(CompilerOptions::default()), vec![file], vec![], compare_paths_options);
let host = tsrs_compiler::new_compiler_host(&cwd, fs, &bundled::default_lib_path(), None, None, None);
let program = tsrs_compiler::new_program(ProgramOptions::new(P::new(config), host));
```

Parsing one file: `tsrs_parser::parse_source_file(SourceFileParseOptions { file_name, path: tspath::to_path(..), external_module_indicator_options: Default::default() }, text, get_script_kind_from_file_name(name))`.
